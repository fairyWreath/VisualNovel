# VisualNovel
FairyNovel - a visual novel engine made in C++ using the SFML Library.

The engine supports a simple scripting language made to run the game commands.

All of in game behaviours such as sprite displays, texts, music and simple animations can be controlled by the scripting language.
Only in game fonts and non-game UIs(main menu, settings menu, etc.) are currently hard coded.
